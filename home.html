			<p>Hello and welcome! This is my personal website.</p>
			<p>Who am I? I’m just a guy that’s trying to put something out into the world and figuring out what that is.</p>
			<p>How am I doing that? I am building this entire website from absolute scratch - no templates, no nothing made by anyone else (except perhaps images and the source content on which I might make comments on, obviously).</p>
			<p>That should see me through developing some technical skills. In a way, this website is in and of itself my portfolio (don’t worry, my plan is to put more stuff there as I build it along - I actually got a job where I can make stuff!).</p>
			<p>As for the rest, I’m an avid reader, but I’ve been trying to develop a more serious, active approach to my content consumption - inspired, like many others, by the Zettelkasten and how it can be implemented in tools for thought such as Roam Research (there’s an entire community on this subject which will be better able to explain this than I am).  The end result of this is the summary and take of books or content I read, there for your perusal and to enable my better thinking.</p>
			<br>	
			<p>Not much more from me except where to find me! See you around in the ether.</p>
